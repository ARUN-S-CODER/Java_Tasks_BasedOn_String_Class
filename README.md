🎉 # Welcome to my Java_Tasks_BasedOn_String_Class Repository! 🎉

    👋 ## Overview

        This repository showcases my skills in manipulating strings using various methods from the Java String class. 
        It consists of 9 different Java code files, each demonstrating a unique string manipulation technique. 
        From capitalizing words to counting vowels and consonants, this repository covers a range of string operations that are essential for any Java developer.

    📂 ## File List

      1. Capitalise Each Word.java 📈
           Uppercases the first letter of every word in a given string using **split()**, **toUpperCase()**, and **substring()**.
           Example: "hello world" becomes "Hello World"
      2. Count of Substring.java 🔍
          Counts the occurrences of a substring within a given string using **length()**, **substring()**, and **intern()**.
          Example: "hello world" contains 1 occurrence of "world"
      3. Longest Word.java 📊
          Finds the longest word in a list of strings using **length()** and **split()**.
          Example: ["hello", "world", "java"] returns "world"
      4. Palindrome.java 🔁
          Checks if a given string is a palindrome using charAt(), length(), and intern().
          Example: "madam" is a palindrome, while "hello" is not
      5. Remove Duplicates.java 🚫
          Removes duplicate characters from a given string using length() and charAt().
          Example: "hello world" becomes "helo wrd"
      6. Remove Specific Char.java 🚫
          Removes a specified character from a given string using charAt() and length().
          Example: "hello world" with 'h' removed becomes "ello world"
      7. Replace Space with Hyphens.java 📋
          Replaces all spaces in a given string with hyphens using replace().
          Example: "hello world" becomes "hello-world"
      8. Reverse Each Word.java 🔙
          Reverses each word in a given sentence using split(), length(), and charAt().
          Example: "hello world" becomes "olleh dlrow"
      9. Vowel and Consonant Count.java 📊
          Counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string using split(), length(), and charAt().
          Example: "hello world" contains 3 vowels and 7 consonants
